# Just-Another-Minesweeper
Really Just Another Textual Minesweeper

When we designed Just-Another-Minesweeper with Console display, we started with a blank slate. 
That gave us the freedom to imagine something radical, something entirely different. 
Another Minesweeper so thin, so light, and so powerful it’s like nothing you’ve ever seen before. 
Another Minesweeper designed for the future, but ready to use today. 

Less has never been more!
